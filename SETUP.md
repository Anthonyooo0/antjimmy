## 🔧 Customization

### Adding More Context to the AI
To add more information about yourself to the AI chatbox:

1. Open `server.js`
2. Find the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` variable (around line 11)
3. Add your additional context to the prompt
4. Restart the server

### Modifying the Design
- **Colors & Styling**: Edit `public/style.css`
- **Content**: Edit `public/index.html`
- **Chat Functionality**: Edit `public/script.js`

## 🎨 Design Features

- **Modern Typography**: Clean, readable fonts with proper hierarchy
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop and mobile
- **Subtle Animations**: Hover effects and smooth transitions
- **Left-aligned Layout**: Inspired by tolunla.de aesthetic
- **Full Chat Interface**: ChatGPT-style chat panel (not a small widget)

## 🤖 AI Chatbox Features

- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses GPT-3.5-turbo for responses
- **Conversation History**: Maintains context across messages
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API errors
- **Responsive UI**: Clean chat interface that adapts to screen size

## 📧 Gmail Setup for Contact Form

The contact form uses Gmail SMTP to send emails. You need to set up a Gmail App Password:

1. **Enable 2-Step Verification** on your Gmail account:
   - Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
   - Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled

2. **Create an App Password**:
   - Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
   - Click on "2-Step Verification"
   - Scroll down to "App passwords"
   - Select "Mail" and your device
   - Copy the generated 16-character password

3. **Update your .env file**:
   ```bash
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
   ```

**Important**: Use the App Password, not your regular Gmail password. Regular passwords will not work with nodemailer.

## 📝 Notes

- The AI chatbox requires a valid OpenAI API key to function
- Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
- The server serves both the backend API and frontend files
- All your personal information is already included in the AI's system prompt
- For the contact form to work, you must configure Gmail App Password authentication
